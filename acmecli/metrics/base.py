"""
Core Metrics Framework for ML Model Trustworthiness Assessment

This module provides the foundational architecture for the ACME Model Scoring system,
defining the standardized interfaces and performance measurement infrastructure that
ensures consistent, reliable evaluation across all trustworthiness dimensions.

The framework enforces a uniform scoring protocol where all metrics return normalized
scores in the [0,1] range with precise timing measurements, enabling fair comparison
and aggregation across diverse evaluation criteria. This design supports both
real-time individual assessments and large-scale batch processing for enterprise
model selection workflows.

Key Design Principles:
- Protocol-based interfaces for extensible metric development
- Automatic performance timing for system monitoring and optimization
- Score normalization and validation for consistent interpretation
- Type safety and runtime error prevention through comprehensive validation

    Standardized interface for all model trustworthiness assessment metrics.

    Defines the contract that all evaluation metrics must implement to ensure
    consistent behavior, reliable timing measurement, and normalized scoring
    across the entire assessment framework.

    This protocol enables the scoring system to treat all metrics uniformly
    while maintaining type safety and performance monitoring capabilities
    essential for production deployment scenarios.

    Performance monitoring decorator for metric functions with automatic score validation.

    Wraps scoring functions to provide precise execution timing and enforce score
    normalization to the [0,1] range. This decorator is essential for system monitoring,
    performance optimization, and ensuring consistent score interpretation across
    all trustworthiness dimensions.

    Features:
    - High-precision timing using performance counters
    - Automatic score clamping to valid [0,1] range
    - Latency measurement in milliseconds for monitoring
    - Type safety with proper return value validation

    This decorator is applied to all scoring functions to maintain consistent
    performance characteristics and enable comprehensive system monitoring
    for production deployment reliability.
