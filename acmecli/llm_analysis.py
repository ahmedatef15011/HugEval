LLM-Enhanced Model Documentation Analysis System

This module implements sophisticated natural language processing capabilities for analyzing
machine learning model documentation quality using Large Language Models. The system
provides both OpenAI API integration and intelligent local fallback analysis to ensure
robust operation across different deployment environments.

The LLM integration specifically enhances the ramp_up_time metric by analyzing README
content for documentation quality, ease of use indicators, and practical examples.
This approach provides more nuanced assessment than traditional keyword-based analysis,
particularly valuable for evaluating model trustworthiness and developer experience.

Key capabilities include real-time README analysis, quality scoring enhancement,
and seamless fallback to local analysis when API access is unavailable.
